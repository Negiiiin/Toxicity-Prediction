# predictive-toxicology

This project uses the data from PubChem to predict if a new substance can cause teratogenicity during pregnancy or not.

I used decision tree, gradient boosting, KNN, logistic regression and neural network in this project.

Since the data was imbalanced I used oversampling to make it balanced.
